# FlappyBirdRL

FlappyBirdRL is a reinforcement learning implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game. In this project, an agent is trained to play Flappy Bird using deep reinforcement learning technique called A2C. The agent learns to navigate through obstacles by maximizing its score through trial and error.

This project provides a solid foundation for experimenting with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and applying them to simple game environments.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Train agents using A2C or other RL algorithms.
- **Customizable Environment**: The Flappy Bird game environment is designed to be easily modified for different scenarios.
- **Agent Training**: The agent learns to play the game and maximize its score over time.
- **Visualization**: Real-time visualization of the agentâ€™s performance during training.
